The website has been in dire need of some maintenance, and updates. We are currently using a much simpler format to make updates and management easier to do. 

The website is built entirely using the **Distill** Rmarkdown format, hosted on Github and deployed by Netlifly. Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web. Learn more about using Distill at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>.
