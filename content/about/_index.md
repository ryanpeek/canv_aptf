The California/Nevada Working Group seeks to understand and reverse amphibian population declines in California and Nevada, and to provide for the continued existence of both declining and non-declining species. A prime objective of the group is to facilitate communication among individuals who conduct scientific investigations, manage natural resources, or influence conservation policy. The group holds an annual meeting to present and discuss new information and issues, and distributes information and ideas via an electronic mailing list. Participation in the group is effected by joining the mailing list. The group is chaired by Dr. David Bradford.
